# Best Practices

## Brevity
- Not too wordy
- Use visuals to communicate and help user navigate
- Have only content relevant to developers

## Language
- Simple up-to-date language that avoids jargon

## Navigability
- Minimize number of clicks it takes to get the developer to the page she is looking for

## Documentation
- The API endpoints are clearly marked
- The required and optional query properties are listed
- Sample query url and response object are provided
- Specify response format (json, xml, etc)
- Cater to beginner and experienced developers

## Data quality
- The data sets are described in plain and precise language
- State the last time data was updated or the frequency of updates

## Support
- Sample code is featured on github in 1 or 2 commonly used languages (python, ruby, node, php)
- Have some sort of experiment tool so that you can test the relevance/quality of data before singing up for keys
