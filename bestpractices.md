# Best Practices
The purpose of this list is to recommend some of the qualities and features of some of the best /developer pages in the US government's open data sphere.

## Focus
- Use concise language
- Use visuals to communicate and help user navigate
- Provide only content relevant to developers

## Language
- Avoid jargon

## Navigability
- Minimize number of clicks it takes to get the developer to the page she is looking for

## Documentation
- Mark API endpoints clearly
- List required and optional query properties
- Provide sample query URLs and response objects
- Specify response format (JSON, XML, etc)
- Cater to beginner and experienced developers

## Data Quality
- Describe data sets in plain and precise language
- State the last time data was updated or the frequency of updates

## Support
- Feature sample code on github in 1 or 2 commonly used languages (python, ruby, node, php)
- Provide some sort of experiment tool for developers to test the relevance/quality of data before singing up for keys

An example of great support found on [this developer page] on the U.S. Department of Labor's website.
